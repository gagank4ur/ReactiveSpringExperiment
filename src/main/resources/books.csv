Some of that might be due to the fact that I don't like letters as a format in books. It was great seeing old characters again and I did like how the mystery slowly filled in piece by piece. I do kinda wish that this has been told from the point of view of Rider though. The excerpt from their point of view was my favourite bit. It's done some great set up for a future book so I look forward to reading more.,"",,"",Yes

It is brutal, disturbing and sickening at points. What you want to happen, doesn't happen. It is also brilliant. It starts off with a bunch of my favourite overused  tropes but where is goes is unexpected. The characters are flawed, they are angry, arrogant and stubborn. You start to like them, root for them but then they do something that you don't agree with, that makes you uncomfortable. But then you understand why they did it and it makes it harder to condemn them.<br> <br>The author did a blog on why she went so graphic with the violence (https://rfkuang.com/2018/05/13/on-the-necessity-of-brutality-why-i-went-there/ ) I highly recommend reading it as explains her reasoning and has a list of content warnings.","",,"",Yes

I loved the exploration of power and the abuse of that power. The second time around I didn't enjoy it as much, though I left my initial rating alone. The first 60% I still love, I was again completely caught up in the story and entranced. After that I found some of the characters' actions and motivations a bit unbelievable.

It took me a while to get into it (it's a slow start) but once I'd adjusted to the style of writing and we'd met the main characters it started to really shine. I loved the dynamic between Prunella and Zacharias. They had such distinct personalities so even though I often disagreed with the decisions that they were making, I could see exactly why they were doing it. I liked how the book uses a bunch of ""gentleman"" magicians in Regency England as a way to explore the discrimination that a lot of fiction set in that period ignores. It does this as part of a highly entertaining and whimsical plot full of magic, assassination attempts, politics and more.","",,"",Yes

It follows the classic patterns of myths and fairytales so you can often see where the story is going but the telling of it draws you in and brings you along on the journey. Accidentally waking up a God of Death and being dragged along on a quest to regain his throne is not going to be a pleasant journey but we got to see the good and the bad, and the in-between. Our protagonist becomes aware of the tropes she is following, contrasting with the stories she herself knows and starting to feel the shape of the narrative she is in which was an aspect I really enjoyed. I also liked getting the points of view of some of the villainous characters, while they were the still the classic ""bad guys"" it gave them some extra depth that you often miss in stories like these. </div>","",,"",Yes

Younger me also thought being known as the translation of my name would be super cool too and the word ""Sky"" is still in a lot of my usernames.

I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of their points of view and I love how their relationship develops throughout the book.

The Left Hand of Darkness,Ursula K.

What brought it up from a 3 star was the strength of the world building and the portrayal of misunderstanding between cultures. What irritated me was the use of the male pronoun to describe the androgynous people of Gethen (I really wish she had used 'they' or invented a pronoun) combined with the sexist, old fashioned views of Genly, our main point of view character from Earth. His views on women and what he considered feminine traits annoyed me throughout the whole book. If you can look past that, the world she has created is intricate and detailed. The relationship between the two main characters and how it develops throughout the book (especially in the second half when they start to grasp just how alien their cultures are) is really well done. Additionally, the interludes in the book, sharing stories from the world history, are fascinating and add to the story without making it seem disjointed. And so it gets four stars from me but with reservations. It is a good book but a flawed one.</div>","",,"",No

I didn't think I could enjoy a book mainly in the second person this much but it was amazing. It was slow, full of flashbacks and info dumps and yet I was fascinated on every page. The narrator finds life and the nature of things interesting and is articulate enough to draw you in to the world building without it getting dry. The way the gods interact and the relationship between worship and power was so intricately weaved. As is the story of the narrator with the story of Eolo (or you). It feels like a book that perfectly executed what it set out to do which I found intensely satisfying. It's definitely not a book for everyone, the format is definitely strange but if you can get used to the style it is a beautiful piece of story telling.","",,"",Yes

They did it with Pet (which I enjoyed so much that I strayed from my comfort zone to read this) and they did it here. <br><br>Ada is a character described as having ""one foot on the other side"". She shares her body with spirits and goes through some very traumatic things. This book tackles faith, abuse, gender identity, sexuality and mental health.

I hope that the people who need it, find this book and feel seen.

It's a lesson rather than a story but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br><br>What made it tiring for me was that the chapters from the point of view of the villain were full of sexist, racist and fatphobic comments and I just didn't want to have to repeatedly read his arrogant, vile thoughts. I would have stopped reading for this reason if it hadn't been for a book club. The other two contrasting point of view characters were more nuanced and there was some interesting world building, particularly around the indigenous culture but it was a book with a point to make and everything else felt secondary. <br><br>The point is an important one, about the evils of colonisation and the harm of seeing people different to yourself as lesser. The author says in her introduction she wrote it when she felt helpless protesting against the Vietnam War and knew that the moralising aspects are visible. I can imagine this being particularly powerful in that time and to anyone who has a connection with that history. <br><br>The only other book I've read by Le Guin is The Left Hand of Darkness and this one pales in comparison so I think part of my struggle was one of mismatched expectations.

Through a wandering, at points almost lyrical narrative you slowly build up a picture of the oppressive Gilead. It's not about an amazing hero or the flame of a revolution. You follow a regular girl, trying to cope with what has happened. The story is fractured, switching tense often between what is happening, how things used to be and hints of the journey between them. There are brief glimpses of a revolution, tantalising at the edges of the story but apart from that, for Offred the world is bleak. This is the only reason I haven't given this more stars. I loved the writing but I needed hope.  I wanted the story behind the revolution, of Ofglen or even Moria as more things would have happened.  Offred's story with a lack of hope, with scared acceptance on one hand and small bouts defiance on the other was strangely brutal. It's definitely a book that'll stay with me but I can't say it was enjoyable to read.","",,"",No

They are talented, a bit naive but jobless and desperate so they accept a job working for the government set up by the people who invaded their country. It's a job working with automaton soldiers that are powered by magic. <br><br>Now the sci-fi fantasy mash up of machines powered by magic pigments was SO COOL, especially the sentient dragon Arazi who I loved. The entire construction of the magic system was so detailed and so unlike anything I've read. Parts of it were reminiscent of programming, it was twisted and different but there was still enough there to make it feel tangible. <br><br>The rest of the world building and politics is also really well done but my favourite part was the characters and the relationships between them. I loved the complex relationship that Jebi has with their sister and how it changes. I also really liked the romance which is rare for me to say, there were so many layers and conflicting feelings.<br><br>The only thing that made me contemplate dropping my rating a bit was that it's a standalone and I want more! There is quite a lot of stuff unresolved at the end, we get a glimpse into the world and see Jebi go on a journey and grow as a character but the overall conflict is still going and it's frustrating knowing we won't get to see any of it. In the end, I loved it anyway and it gets a full five stars from me.<br><br>If you've read Ninefox Gambit, I feel obligated to say this is nothing like that. If you liked that series, this is completely different so don't come in expecting something of the same scope. If you didn't like it (I was not a big fan), again this is completely different, it's worth trying Phoenix Extravagant if you're interested in the premise. </div>","","","physical-copy, adult-sff-by-aoc-2020",Yes

It took me longer to read than I expected as it's a book that requires concentration and I wanted to take my time and enjoy the writing.

That combined with the disjointed timelines kept me in a constant state of confusion for most of the book which may not sound like a good thing but it definitely was.

I love the character development in this series, Murderbot grows so much as a person and the way it comes to realize that it has people who care and don't view it at dispensible makes my heart warm.<br><br>It's action packed and has a great plot, but lucky for me it didn't require a huge amount of energy to read. Not only was I was able to read it after a tiring day at work without zoning out but often I would sit down to read for twenty minutes and look up an hour later realising I should probably go to bed. It was funny and it was gripping and it made me happy. <br><br><br></div>","","","priority, ebook, kobo",Yes

Arwa's journey begins where most end, she is widowed, full of grief, fear and rage. Her response, try to save the cursed empire from its fate. The characters in this book shine, especially Arwa and Zahir, and it's wonderful to watch how their dynamic changes though the story. The world building and politics are also strong but the magic system we explore in this book is stunning.

It's set in New Salem against the backdrop of women's suffrage and the entire atmosphere was perfect.<br><br>I loved how magic was woven into the story, there are little spells at the beginning of each chapter and mini fairytale retellings throughout, all of which fed into the story. I also loved the relationship between our three sisters and how it develops. As you alternate between them as point of view characters, you get all of their perspectives on what broke them apart in the first place and get to see them rebuild their relationship.<br><br>One problem I had with the book was the pacing, I actually think it would have worked better as a trilogy.

It was the result of breaking an oath, but he can't remember having done that. I really enjoyed seeing how he deals with the results of the mental conditioning, finding he knows things that he has no memory learning, the instinct that he recognises something but not knowing where from.<br><br>The world building is great. There are twin empires run by immortal emporors who are perpetually at war with each other. The spaceships that fight in the war are flown by people ""webbing"" with them which allows the crew to control the ship's systems with their minds. The world is also diverse without making a big deal about it which I loved.<br><br>I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with the ending.

The world-building continues to be my favourite part of this trilogy, it's so intricate and beautiful. One the things I loved about the first two books was that I had no idea where it was going. That understandably gets lost in this book, as everything was leading up to this point, but I missed the atmosphere of mystery. What we do get is a filling in of the blanks, the whole picture comes into focus and we finally get to see the entire scope of things. The characters also get some more attention in this book and seeing both Essun's and Nassun's point of view was heart-breaking.

I immediately clicked with the tone and style it was written in and the story swept me away.<br><br>Linus is 40 years old, lives with his cat and is committed to his job overseeing orphanages that take care of magical children. He lives his life according to the rules and does nothing unexpected. When he gets sent on a month long secret assignment to a far away orphanage with 6 unusual and dangerous children and their charming caretaker, everything gets turned upside down.<br><br>I loved all of the characters so much. I laughed several times at the children's antics or Linus's awkwardness and at other times my heart ached for them.  The story explores being different and feared, finding a place where you belong and fighting for those you care about. It's heartwarming and wholesome and hopeful and I loved it.</div>","",,"",Yes

I think the strange quality mainly came from the tone often being quite disjoint from the subject being dealt with. Everything is presented to you in the same way, no matter whether it's magic, technology, bullying or bodily functions. There's an interesting mix of fantasy and sci-fi but the characters' lives and problems take centre stage. You see various snapshots showing how they deal with the highs and lows of living your life while trying to do the right thing. It is a great illustration of how people can have very different concepts of what is ""right"".  I was a little disappointed with the ending as the build up is better than the resolution. All in all I'm glad I read it but I probably won't read it again.","",,"",No

The wonderful Agent Fatma comes to investigate and from there we get to explore all over to find our mysterious killer, who claims to be a powerful historical figure returned to this world. <br><br>This book is also so much more than a murder mystery, it's alternate history, explores politics, romance, fantasy (obviously) and more. It also made me laugh so many times. The pace started off pretty slow (at least compared to how quickly things move in the short stories and novellas) but it gives time to explore more of the world and characters. The second half picks up the pace dramatically and I raced through it. <br><br>The characters are wonderful, there are so many strong female characters and while they are underestimated by people who don't know them they are unapologetically great at what they do. There's a big focus on the outcasts of society, those who are left behind, discriminated against or condemned for their beliefs. It gives the world more depth, we see all aspects of society and how they interact with eachother hugely impacts the flow of the plot. <br><br>I've really enjoyed everything that I've read which has been set in this world and I was so happy to get a full length novel.

The characters are what makes this series so special and no other books have made me feel so attached to fictional people. This book is just a taste of what is to come. We get introduced to the world, the magics, the politics and see it all through the eyes of Fitz. We begin when he is five, thrust into an unfamiliar environment and we learn as he does. As the title suggests, he learns to be an assassin but it's so much more than that and there are many forces at play. <br><br>It was strange going straight from book 16 in the world to book 1 (but that was my fault for recommending it to book club). It really highlighted to me how much of a beginning this is, glimpses of characters I have come to love, making me want to rush on to read more.

Above all, Tarisai is lonely and when she goes out into the world to carry out her task, she forms connections with other children with their own powers, many of whom are lonely too. It's a take on found family that felt deeply real and the few side characters that I got to know well, I loved.<br><br>That is just the tiniest glimpse of what is inside the book, there's a complicated political system with its own history of how the empire came to be and its own version of the lies that history tells. An ancient war between realms and a high price that is paid in the name of peace. Raybearer completely immerses you in this world and at the end I was immediately checking for when the sequel is out.

The beginning and set up was okay but the meat of the book was relatively good. It kept me gripped and I wanted to know how it would end.

Reading has sort of felt like a chore during lockdown, I've really struggled with anything longer than a novella but this book swept me away. <br><br>It's a strange story full of longing for things that no longer exist. The world building is great and the plot moves at a full on pace but as usual for me it's characters that drew me in. Sophie and Mouth were fantastic points of view and the contrast between them was brilliant. The dynamics between them and the rest of the cast felt so realistic and I loved seeing how they grew and changed. <br><br>I do need to mention how much I love an environment and aliens that *feel* alien and different. The hostility of living on January, the dangers of straying into the Day or Night and the strangeness of the Gelet all added together to make a really atmospheric read.</div>","",,"",Yes

I think I actually enjoyed it more in this format than I would have reading it even though it took me much longer. Narration 5 stars, story 3.5 stars. Firstly, the storytelling is wonderful, I loved being back in this world. I remember the magic when first reading His Dark materials when I was eleven, which was missing when I reread them as an adult. That magic was back when I started reading this book and my heart broke several times for Lyra and Pan. There were several other characters that I grew to love and really enjoyed getting to know better. Sound like a five star read? <br><br>Well it would have been if there hadn't been several things that made me uncomfortable. The romance for one was really strange, with Lyra's teacher admitting to being attracted to her since she was young teen and then everything is fine because she's 20 now. An other was descriptions of characters that threw me off. One of these was about a character who is ""not beautiful"" but could show an ""intense sexuality"" which is a skill she uses to make the men in the room uncomfortable, it didn't add anything to the scene which otherwise shows a brave women standing up to a bunch of horrible men. I won't go on listing examples of parts that made me uncomfortable and were unnecessary for the plot but there were enough of them to impact my view of the book significantly. <br><br>I also wasn't particularly happy with the ending as it didn't end so much as stop, it felt like a book which has been chopped in half because it was too long.  I'm torn as I did really enjoy the story, I loved listening to it and I desperately want to know what happens but in my opinion you could cut a good chunk of stuff out and end up with something even better.","",,"",Yes

I read the second half of this book with a voice in the back of my head screaming in awe. The world building (universe building) is so intricate, with politics on so many different levels and multiple different cultures. By this book you already have a detailed picture of the empire built up so a lot of the focus is on the characters and the politics. Breq feels so real and she's so clearly still Justice of Toren. I also loved getting to know Station and some of the other ships. It's a fascinating take on sentient AIs, probably the best I've ever read.<br><br>One of my favourite things about this series is how gender ceases to matter when reading about a society that doesn't register a difference. There are no gender roles and IT DOESN'T MATTER. There is still discrimination, along class and racial lines, which is done really well and we see the injustice of all of this through Breq's eyes. I found seeing Seivarden's struggle with her own biases and her growth as a character really interesting. This has definitely become one of my favourite sci-fi series.","",,"",Yes

I continually wanted to pick it up, and when I wasn't reading it I was often thinking about it. The characters drew me in, Aster the protagonist especially, and I loved seeing things from her world view which is so different from my own. All the characters that we get to know, are complex layered and have multiple aspects to them which makes them feel real. I loved having a few chapters sprinkled in from  different character points of view as they all had something to add. <br><br>It's set on a spaceship which is traveling to a promised land after the Earth is destroyed and generations have passed since they left. It deals heavily with slavery, with the coloured lower deck inhabitants like Aster, treated as less than human and only there as tools. Frequent trauma is a reality that most of the characters are used to and deeply affects how they act. It always impresses me when an author manages to take such dark themes and build a story that pulls me in and makes me think without it becoming too depressing to pick up. It really is a great debut and now I need to read anything else I can find by Rivers Solomon because I can't wait to see what else they come up with. </div>","",,"",No

The magic system is gloriously dark and this book doesn't pull its punches. There were several times I audibly exclaimed in shock and times I laughed out loud. Unfortunately there were a few parts where I struggled to keep track of all the secondary characters. A lot of them have several names and it could get confusing at points. It probably didn't help that I read it over a long period of time. The ending was epic though and not at all what I expected. Definitely looking forward to the next one!,"",,"",Yes

The chapters are quite small so you can fly through them pretty quickly, it meant even if I had just a short time to read, it still felt worth it a I knew I could still get through a few chapters. <br><br>So all in all it was amazing and I need book two to be announced ASAP! </div>","","","physical-copy, adult-sff-by-aoc-2020",Yes

I was intrigued at the beginning and once I stopped trying to give some meaning to the mathematical words and saw it as magic I started to get into it. I loved the dynamic between Cheris and Jedao however most of the other characters were pretty flat. Part of the problem is that I wasn't really interested in the battle and so I can see how other people could enjoy this more than me. As it went on I got bored with the other characters’ perspectives and while the first few flashbacks were interesting there were too many in one go and it got annoying.

It's a book about struggling with discrimination and anxiety whilst fighting for the dream of being an astronaut in an alt history post WW2 setting.

However all of that is spoilers so instead you get this which I don't think quite gets across how much I loved this so first know this. I haven't read a book since, it's been two weeks and my mind is still stuck on this world and these characters.<br><br>The Jasmine Throne looks at empire from many points of view. From those who are oppressed, those wanting to tear it down, those trying to ""maintain the peace"", those that think that they are inherently superior and those who just want to be free. There are way more than two sides to this story. <br><br>Priya is a maidservant, has spent most of her life hiding that she was ever anything else. She is a fighter and strong, brave but also kind. Malini is princess imprisoned by her brother. She is cunning, manipulative and caring. Both dangerous in their own way and are thrown together when Priya is sent to clean the ancient temple Malini is imprisoned in. They are joined by a cast of many others, people who are intertwined into their lives and have their own vision of what life should be.<br><br>I loved how the story was built up. I always find the beginning of multiple POV books slow as we get to know the characters, but once we did it picked up and I loved seeing how all the threads intertwined. Priya was my favourite but I loved so many of the characters and even if I didn't agree with their actions, I understood them. There are also several characters that are extremely satisfying to hate. I really want to say more here but since I'm trying to avoid spoilers, just message me when you read it.<br><br>The magic system is also very cool. It is deeply linked with plants and the earth, and there is an insidious illness where those suffering from ""the rot"" have plants growing through and out of them. The imagery is both disturbing and beautiful. There are multiple mythologies and religions from the different lands, we get to see a few of them but you know there's more. I really liked how these were woven into the story, no one doubts that each has its own truth and power but fear of that power has caused a lot of destruction.<br><br></div>","Moderate: Violence, Body horror, Physical abuse, and Murder; ","","",Yes

The interweaving of Inuit and Norse Mythology was fascinating as was the exploration of the meeting of different cultures. I love the main character Omat so much.

He has his own struggles with his past and culture. Their attempts at communication without knowing the same language were really great to read. The book is pretty dark and violent at points but it also has humour plus some really touching and emotional moments.

Getting to know more about the stone eaters is fascinating and some of the non point of view characters get more fleshed out this time which is another plus.

I immediately got sucked into this story and if I hadn't been reading on a train I probably could have read it in one sitting. The story and characters just feel so real. Before reading this, the historical context of the book both made me want to read this and made me put it off a few times because I was worried it would be too heavy or depressing for how I was feeling. I underestimated the power of Butler's writing. As I expected what Dana goes through and sees is horrific but her emotional journey and turmoil is also incredibly moving. Dana herself is a brilliant character and the supporting cast is also vivid in my mind.

After we leave the court, things get more mysterious and otherworldly. I loved the world building, Chokshi's writing is lyrical and beautiful, creating such vivid pictures of everything in my mind. I wasn't a huge fan of the romance, which is a fairly prominent part of the book, but I was still invested in the story around it.

This book feels like an entire series in one book, the character development is incredible. All the charecters are really well drawn, including the villians and the complex web of relationships between them all were the highlight of the book. It's more graphic than what I usually read, and given that the protagonist has been marked by a god to enjoy pain and is often enslaved in some form, they are not often scenes that are enjoyable to read. However it didn't take away from the book and Phedre's conflicted feelings that stem from her mark, gave an extra dimension to her character.  I went from slightly bored to completely engrossed to staying up till 1am to finish it. It was a world I could get completely lost in and I overall I loved it.
